## Milestone 2

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The data set we have chosen was provided on data.world by [Chris Awram](data.world/awram) who collected from the following sources: [fatalencounters.org](fatalencounters.org), [gunviolencearchive.org](gunviolencearchive.org), and [The Washington Post's Data on Police Shootings](github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings). The dataset consists of twelve columns or variables, including UID (identification number), name, age, gender, race, date, city, state, manner of death, whether they were armed, mental illness, and if they were fleeing. There are 12491 rows or occurrences in the dataset, which were collected across the years 2000 to 2016. The purpose of this dataset is to give insights into variables related to individuals killed by the police in the United States. The dataset was likely uploaded for public interest and to allow people to do analyses to improve understanding of police related deaths. Improved understanding of police related deaths can help spur the enforcement of new standards of transparency and accountability for the behaviour of law enforcement. It is not entirely clear how the data was collected by the original sources, but I speculate it came from historical records digitized. There was some data cleaning done by [Chris Awram](data.world/awram).
