# Group 09 - Investigating Police Involved Fatalities in the U.S.


## Milestone 2

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this analytics project, we aim to sharpen our data handling and analyzing skills with real world data. We hope to gain insights into the factors which may contribute to creating a situation where a law enforcement officer kills a civilian. Specific demographic variables such as gender, race, and age will be interesting to analyze to uncover group differences existing in the data of police related fatalities. The relationship between victim mental illness and whether they fled from the police could have important results. Race or genderâ€™s relationship with manner of death could be interesting, as well as the relationship between age and mental health status. We are interested in this topic because the data provides rich insights into law enforcement violence and certain demographic characteristics. Due to the categorical nature of much of the variables in this dataset, bar graph type visuals could be helpful for displaying group differences between variables on a dashboard


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set we have chosen was provided on data.world by Chris Awram who collected from the following sources: fatalencounters.org, gunviolencearchive.org, and github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings. The dataset consists of twelve columns or variables, including UID (identification number), name, age, gender, race, date, city, state, manner of death, whether they were armed, mental illness, and if they were fleeing. There are 12491 rows or occurrences in the dataset, which were collected across the years 2000 to 2016. The purpose of this dataset is to give insights into variables related to individuals killed by the police in the United States. The dataset was likely uploaded for public interest and to allow people to do analyses to improve understanding of police related deaths. Improved understanding of police related deaths can help spur the enforcement of new standards of transparency and accountability for the behaviour of law enforcement. It is not entirely clear how the data was collected by the original sources, but I speculate it came from historical records digitized. There was some data cleaning done by Chris Awram.
