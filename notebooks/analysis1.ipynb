    "I am interested in exploring the relationship between the race of the victims and the states that police fatalities occur in (location). I believe that by exploring this relationship, it may provide insight into whether the views and prejudices potentially held by police officers in each state, may contribute to whether a specific race is disproportionally impacted by police fatalities."

    "The data set we have chosen was provided on data.world by Chris Awram who collected from the following sources: fatalencounters.org, gunviolencearchive.org, and github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings. The dataset consists of twelve columns or variables, including UID (identification number), name, age, gender, race, date, city, state, manner of death, whether they were armed, mental illness, and if they were fleeing. There are 12491 rows or occurrences in the dataset, which were collected across the years 2000 to 2016. The purpose of this dataset is to give insights into variables related to individuals killed by the police in the United States. The dataset was likely uploaded for public interest and to allow people to do analyses to improve understanding of police related deaths. Improved understanding of police related deaths can help spur the enforcement of new standards of transparency and accountability for the behaviour of law enforcement. It is not entirely clear how the data was collected by the original sources, but I speculate it came from historical records digitized. There was some data cleaning done by Chris Awram."

    "    There were a total of 12,491 police fatalities in this dataset. The earliest date present in the dataset was January 1st, 2001 and the latest date present in the dataset was September 9th, 2016. Therefore, the data within this dataset are cases between those two dates. With this in mind, not only is it important for my research question to take note of the data involving cities,states and races, but also the dates because that could influence the kind of beliefs held by specific states.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Variable 1: Race**:\n",
    "    There were 8526 non-null values within the Race column, along with 3965 null values. There were 6 unqiue values, showing that there were 6 unique race categories present in the dataset. I noticed that there was also an 'other' category for the race column and found that interesting since I wondered what 'other' meant in terms of race. Additionally, the race with the highest number of police fatality cases was white with a frequency of 3855 cases. I found this to be surprising due to belief that the race of the highest number of police fatalitiy cases would be that of a minority race in the United States. The race with second highest number of police fatality cases was black (2536 cases) and the race with the third highest was hispanic (1784 cases).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable 2: Date**:\n",
    "    There were 12,491 non-null values within the Date column and no null values. There a total of 4848 unique dates with January 26th, 2016 holding the highest number of police fatality cases (18 cases). As stated, the earliest date found was January 1st, 2001 and the latest date found was September 9th, 2016. I found it surprising that there were 48 dates with more than 10 police fatalities within 1 day and wonder whether these incidences occured in the same areas as well. Additionally, the year with the highest number of police fatalities was 2015 followed by 2016 and 2014. This was an interesting turnout and made me wonder as to why the cases in 2015 were particularily high and whether this is related to beliefs in an area changing in relation to time or whether it could be related to race in terms of beliefs towards a race changing in a specific area.\n",

    "**3a) City:**\n",
    "    There were 12,487 non-null values within the City column, along with 4 null values. There were 3327 unique cities with police fatalities as well. The city with the highest number of police fatalities was Los Angeles with 297 cases followed by Houston (247 cases) and Phoenix (177 cases). Moreover, there were a total of 7 cities with over 100 police fatality cases, and 1774 cities with 1 police fatality case within the timespan that the data was gathered in. The mean was around 3-4 cases per city stated in the dataset and the median was 1 case. There could be many factors related to the number of cases and the cities. But I am hoping to uncover whether there being over 100 police fatalities in certain cities while there are only 1 in other cities is related to race.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3b) State:**\n",
    "    There were 12,491 non-null values within the State column and no null values. There were 51 unique states which makes me wonder why there are 51 instead of 50 since the United States only has 50 states. Other than that, California had the highest number of police fatalities with 2913 cases, followed by Texas (1190 cases) and Florida (1028). That said, North Dakota (13 cases), Rhode Island (20 cases) and Vermont (21 cases) has the least number of police fatalities. My interests in the relationship between the number of cases and states in similar as for cities. I found it interesting that California had the highest number of cases, however texas being amoung the higher case frequencies did not surprise me. The mean number of cases per state was around 244-245 cases per state and the median was 128 cases.\n"
